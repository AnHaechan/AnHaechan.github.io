		    Currently I'm doing my masters program at KAIST Graduate School of Computing, under the advisement of
		    <a href = "https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/jeehoon.kang/"> Prof. Jeehoon Kang, of KAIST Concurrency & Parallelsim Lab</a>. </br>
                My interests are: AI systems, compilers, programming languages and machine learning.</br>
                I want to build a compiler, runtime and programming model that fill the gap between large AI models and heterogeneous hardwares, e.g., NPU and PIM.

		<h3> Research Topic: AI compilers for NPU/PIM accelerators </h3>
		<p>
		    Deep learning models, such as generative AI, are increasingly demanding more computation, memory and bandwidth.
	  		</br>
		    To efficiently handle those resource demands, (1) various specialized accelerators have been proposed
		    and (2) the model executions are being distributed to multiple hardwares.
			</br>
		    The benefit of using multiple heterogeneous accelerators can only be utilized by a software stack,
		    including specialized compiler and runtime, which bridge the high-level application and low-level hardwares.
			</br>
		    However, currently there are limited compiler support that can automatically generate efficient execution plans
		    for varying models, given multiple different accelerators including NPU(Neural Processing Unit) and PIM(Processing In Memory).
			</br>
		    My research goal is to design such <b>AI compilers for distributed & heterogeneous accelerators</b>.
