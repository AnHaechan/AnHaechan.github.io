            <p>
		    I'm pursuing a master's degree at the graduate school of computing at KAIST, under the advisement of
		    <a href = "https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/jeehoon.kang/"> Prof. Jeehoon Kang, at KAIST Concurrency & Parallelsim Lab</a>. </br>
                My interests are: systems programming, compilers, machine learnings and programming languages.</br>
                I want to build a compiler, runtime and programming model that fill the gap between larger and larger AI models and more and more heterogenous architectures.

		<h3> Current Research Topic </h3>
		<p>
            <h4>AI compilers for distributed & heterogeneous accelerators</h4>
		    Deep learning models, such as generative AI, are increasingly demanding more computation, memory and bandwidth.
	  		</br>
		    To efficiently handle those resource demands, (1) various specialized accelerators have been proposed
		    and (2) the model executions are being distributed to multiple hardwares.
			</br>
		    The benefit of using multiple heterogeneous accelerators can only be utilized by a software stack,
		    including specialized compiler and runtime, which bridges the high-level application and low-level hardwares.
			</br>
		    However, currently there are limited compiler support that can automatically generate efficient execution plans
		    for varying models, given multiple different accelerators including NPU(Neural Processing Unit) and PIM(Processing In Memory).
			</br>
		    My research goal is to design such <b>"AI compilers for distributed & heterogeneous accelerators"</b>.
